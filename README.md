# Project Goal
------------
Analyze the U.S. Department of Labor statistics data for the U.S. labor force. Looking at the data, I want to try and predict future employment/ unemployment rate based on previous years data, if possible with the data available. Barring that, analyzing the data may also give insight into what populations have been affected the most when economic With the data being sorted within a timeframe, it will be an excellent opportunity to continue honing my time series analysis skills.

If any other notable trends appear they will certainly be investigated, and suggestions on how to better the dataframe or what other features would be helpful for analysis.



Initial Questions
-----------------
* Is there a noticable trend or seasonality present in the data?

* Has unemployment rate increased for one population over another?

* What gender improved their employment rate the most?

* What demographic (race, gender) has decreased the most in employment rate?

* Do we see an even distribution of employment between different dempographic over time?

# Project Planning
Plan -> Acquire -> Prepare -> Explore -> Deliver
Planning:

***Create a README file***
* Ensure my dataprep modules are well documents and functional

***Acquisition***

* Obtain labor.csv from US Department of Labor database via https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/labor/

***Preparation***

* Clean labor data by renaming columns
* Feature Engineer additional columns
* Set datetime index


***Exploration***

* Ask and answer questions about the labor data.
* Visually represent findings with charts. 

***Modeling***

* Build a ML Model to predict possible future trends

***Deliver***

* Deliver a final report with the results of the analysis
